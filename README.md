Code samples for the Modern JS workshop

Each sample has an html file with the <script> tag(s) in it. Ideally, you should run these samples with a simple web server.
The easiest way to browse and run these samples is by using an IDE. For example, download and run the IDE Visual Studio Code and open the folder with these examples in this IDE. 
Then click on the square icon on the left toolbar and find and install the live server extention.
This will allow you to right-click on the html file and select an option Run with Live Server.
